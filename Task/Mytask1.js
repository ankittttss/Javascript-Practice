// Imagine you have an array of integers representing the temperatures recorded over a week. 
// How would you use a "for each" loop to calculate the average temperature?

// const arr = [23,4,5,6,7,8,9];
// let answer = 0;
// let count = 0;
// arr.forEach((item)=>{
//    answer = answer + item;
//    count++;
// })

// console.log(answer/count);
// console.log(answer);
// console.log(count);


// You have a list of strings containing names of students in a class. 
// How would you use a "for each" loop to print out each student's name along with their position in the list (index)?

// let students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Emily"];

// students.forEach((item,index)=>{
//     console.log(item,index);
//     index++;
// })


// Suppose you have a dictionary where the keys are product names and the values are their corresponding prices.
//  How would you use a "for each" loop to calculate the total cost of purchasing all the products?
